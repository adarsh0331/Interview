for key, value in data.items():
    print(f"{key}: {value}")

# Modify or add a new key-value pair
data['new_key'] = 'new_value'

# Write back to the file
with open('text.json', 'w') as f:
    json.dump(data, f, indent=# 4)

o	API Server: Exposes the Kubernetes API.
o	Controller Manager: Ensures that the cluster is in the desired state (e.g., creating new pods when needed).
•	Scheduler: Assigns workloads to nodes.
•	ETCD: is a distributed key-value store used to store all cluster data, including       configuration data, secrets, and state information.
•	Worker Node: Runs the containerized applications. Components include:
•	Kubelet: Ensures the containers are running in a Pod.
•	Kube Proxy: Maintains network rules for Pod communication.
•	Container Runtime: Runs the containers (e.g., Docker).

# 32.What are different types of Kubernetes Services?
A:

ClusterIP – Default, internal-only access
NodePort – Exposes service on a port on each node
LoadBalancer – Uses external load balancer
ExternalName – Maps service to external DNS name
Headless Service – Created by setting clusterIP: None, used for direct pod access, useful in StatefulSets and DNS discovery.

# 33. Q: What is AWS Serverless and what are its key benefits?

•	Elastic Load Balancer (ELB): Distributes traffic across instances to balance load.
•	CloudWatch Alarms: Used to trigger scaling actions.
•	ECS with Fargate or EC# 2: Task-based scaling based on request load or queue depth.

  source = "terraform-aws-modules/vpc/aws"
  version = "# 3.# 0.# 0"
  ...
}

# 89. What are modules in Terraform?

# 95. How do you connect Jenkins to the cloud (AWS)?
Q: How do you connect Jenkins to cloud environments like AWS?
A: I configure Jenkins with AWS CLI/SDK or IAM credentials (via credentials plugin). I install plugins like AWS EC# 2, use IAM roles (on EC# 2 agents), and store secrets in AWS Secrets Manager or Jenkins credentials.

# 96. How many VPCs can you create per region?
Answer:
By default, you can create # 5 VPCs per region per AWS account. This limit can be increased by requesting a quota increase from AWS.

# 97. What is the difference between a private and public subnet?
Answer:
•	Public Subnet: A subnet that is associated with a route table that has a route to an Internet Gateway (IGW). Resources in this subnet can access the internet.
•	Private Subnet: A subnet that does not have a route to the Internet Gateway. Used for internal resources like databases.

# 98. What is a Transit Gateway?
Answer:
An AWS Transit Gateway enables you to connect multiple VPCs and on-premises networks through a central hub, simplifying your network architecture and reducing the number of peering connections.

# 99. What is VPC Peering?
Answer:
VPC Peering allows direct communication between two VPCs in the same or different AWS accounts/regions. It’s non-transitive and is used for point-to-point connectivity.

# 100. What is a VPC Endpoint?
Answer:
A VPC Endpoint allows private connection between your VPC and AWS services (like S# 3, DynamoDB) without using the internet, improving security and performance.

Answer:
You cannot directly rename a database when restoring a snapshot. Instead:
# 1.	Restore the snapshot.
# 2.	Create a new DB instance.
# 3.	Use tools like pg_dump/mysqldump, or AWS DMS to export and import data into a DB with the desired name.

# 108. What are the different scaling strategies in Kubernetes?
Answer:
•	Manual Scaling: Using kubectl scale command or editing the deployment.
•	Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA): Scales pods based on CPU/memory utilization.
•	Vertical Pod Autoscaler (VPA): Adjusts CPU/memory requests/limits.
•	Cluster Autoscaler: Automatically adds/removes nodes based on pod needs.

# 109. What are the Deployment strategies in Kubernetes?
Answer:
•	Rolling Update (default): Gradually replaces old pods with new ones.
•	Recreate: Deletes old pods before creating new ones.
•	Blue/Green Deployment: Deploys new version alongside old one, then switches.
•	Canary Deployment: Gradually rolls out to a small subset before full rollout.

# 110. How can you pause a container?
Answer:
Kubernetes doesn't directly support pausing containers, but you can:
•	Use kubectl rollout pause deployment/<deployment-name> to pause updates.
•	Use Linux SIGSTOP/SIGCONT signals in advanced container runtime setups.

# 111. What are Init Containers?
Answer:
Init containers are special containers that run before app containers in a Pod. They:
•	Run sequentially.
•	Are used for initial setup tasks (e.g., configs, waiting for DB readiness).
•	Must complete successfully for the main container to start.

# 112. What are Sidecar Containers?
Answer:
Sidecars are helper containers that run alongside the main container in the same pod.
Examples:
•	Logging agent
•	Data synchronizer
•	Proxy (like Envoy for service mesh)

# 113. What are the different types of containers in Kubernetes?
Answer:
•	App Containers: Primary application logic.
•	Init Containers: Run before app containers for setup tasks.
•	Sidecar Containers: Provide supporting features (logging, monitoring).
•	Ambassador Containers: Help with service communication/proxying.

# 114. How can you troubleshoot if a Namespace is renamed?
Answer:
•	Namespaces can’t be renamed, only deleted and recreated.
•	If a resource disappears:
o	Check with kubectl get all --all-namespaces
o	Validate configs still reference the correct namespace.

# 115. What is etcd?
Answer:
etcd is a distributed key-value store used by Kubernetes to store all cluster state data (like config, secrets, nodes, etc.). It must be highly available and backed up.

# 116. What is a CRD (Custom Resource Definition)?
Answer:
A CRD lets you define a custom resource (e.g., MySQLCluster) and use it like a native Kubernetes object. It extends Kubernetes capabilities without modifying the core.

•	Security (mTLS)
•	Observability (metrics, tracing)
Examples: Istio, Linkerd

# 119. What is Sidecar Injection?
Answer:
Sidecar injection is the process of automatically adding a sidecar container (like an Envoy proxy) to pods. This is used in service meshes (e.g., Istio) for traffic interception.

# 120. What is Envoy Proxy?
Answer:
Envoy is a high-performance proxy used in service meshes (e.g., Istio) for:
•	Load balancing
•	Traffic routing
•	TLS termination

# 121. What is a Pod Disruption Budget (PDB)?
Answer:
PDB ensures a minimum number of pods are always available during voluntary disruptions (like node drain). You can define:
•	minAvailable
•	maxUnavailable

# 122. What are Probes in Kubernetes?
Answer:
Used to check pod health:
•	Liveness Probe: Restarts container if it's stuck.
•	Readiness Probe: Controls pod availability to services.
•	Startup Probe: For slow-starting apps.

# 123. What is the difference between Voluntary and Involuntary Disruption?
Answer:
•	Voluntary: Triggered by user (e.g., kubectl drain, rolling update).
•	Involuntary: System-triggered (e.g., node crash, OOM).
# 124. What is Safe Eviction vs Hard Eviction?
Answer:
•	Safe Eviction: Graceful shutdown respecting Pod Disruption Budgets and lifecycle hooks.
•	Hard Eviction: Forced eviction due to resource pressure or system errors.

# 125. What are Pod Security Policies (PSP)?
Answer:
(Deprecated in Kubernetes v# 1.# 25)
PSPs controlled security-related settings like:
•	Privileged mode
•	Host namespaces
•	Volume types

•	Ordered, graceful deployment and scaling.
•	Stable network names and storage (e.g., databases).

# 127. What is a Headless Service?
Answer:
A service with clusterIP: None:
•	Doesn't assign a cluster IP.
•	DNS returns the pod IPs directly.
•	Used with StatefulSets for service discovery.

# 128. What is a ReplicaSet?
Answer:
Maintains a stable set of pod replicas.
•	Ensures desired number of pods are running.
•	Used by Deployments internally.


# 129. What is a Deployment object in Kubernetes?
Answer:
A Deployment is used to:
•	Manage ReplicaSets
